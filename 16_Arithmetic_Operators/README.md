# Arithmetic Operators
- Shell script variables are by default treated as a string, not numbers, which adds some complexity to doing math in shell script 

- Even your number in your variable is integer or floating it will treat it as a string

- It is better to use Python or Perl with advanced level of mathimathical calucaltions but if you need to perform it in bash then you have more like a basic operations

- There are different ways to perform arithmetic operations: 
    1. Using `declare`
    2. Using `expr`
    3. Using `let`
